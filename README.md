# Useful sorting algorithms in Python for interviews

1. **Merge sort**

Time complexity - O(NlogN). Takes O(N) of auxiliary space.
Lafore wrote it is useful for hard drive sorts. 

2. **Quick sort**

Time complexity - usually O(NlogN), but O(N) in worst case (it happens if array is sorted as we need and pivot element is the first one). Auxiliary space is O(logN). Very popular algorithm. 

3. **Insertion sort**

Time complexity - O(N^2), space complexity is O(1). It's more powerful on small arrays, so sometimes quicksort optimize with it when subarray size is relatively small.
