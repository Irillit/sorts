Python version of useful sorts for interviews

1 Merge sort 

Time complexity - O(NlogN). Takes O(N) of auxiliary space.
Lafore wrote it is useful for hard drive sorts. 

2. Quick sort

Time complexity - usually O(NlogN), but O(N) in worst case (it happens if array is sorted as we need and pivot element is the first one) 
Very popular algorithm. 

3. Insertion sort
